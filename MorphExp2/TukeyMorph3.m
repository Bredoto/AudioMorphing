function y = TukeyMorph3(a,b,frames)% This function implements John Tukey's suggestion for how to morph between% two spectrogram frames.  First compute the cumulative sum, then match% up points that are equal in (cumulative) energy.  This only works with% inharmonic sounds (or spectral profiles without the pitch).   Also needs% to use the interpolation scheme described on page 117 of my first IRC% log book (TimeWarp).if (nargin < 3) frames = 100; endif (size(a,1) > size(a,2)) a=a'; endif (size(b,1) > size(b,2)) b=b'; endlen = length(a);ca=cumsum(a);ca=ca/ca(len);cb=cumsum(b);cb=cb/cb(len);%plot([ca cb])warp = zeros(size(a));for i=1:len        diff = ca(i) - cb;        [m ind] = min(diff.*diff);        warp(i) = ind;end%plot([ca cb cb(warp)])y=zeros(len,frames);unwarp = (1:len)';for i=1:frames		y(:,i) = TimeWarp(a,b,warp,zeros(1,size(b,2)),(i-1)/(frames-1))';end
